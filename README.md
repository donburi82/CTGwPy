# CTGwPy

A Python program designed to simulate a cardiotocograph (a.k.a. an electronic fetal monitor)

## Description

Cardiotocography is a technical means of recording the fetal hearbeat and the uterine contractions during pregnancy. A cardiotocograph displays those values on the screen and prints out a plot of those values.

This program is designed to:
1) Ask for desired plot rate

![rate](./screenshots/rate.png)

2) Read those values from an external camera which is capturing the screen of a cardiotocograph

![roi](./screenshots/roi.png)

3) Plot a graph and display color gradients of those values

![plot](./screenshots/plot.png)


The program serves as a prototype for further use. For example, one could link the program with a VR glass, in order to keep those values in a safe range by playing appropriate music or videos for the patient.
